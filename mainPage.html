          <b>The main concepts</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to understanding what is happening on the field is to be aware
          of a few concepts. The in-depth details of the sport are apparent to
          only experienced watchers and players, however, knowing a few basics
          can help you successfully engage with the locals. The playing sides
          The field is enormous and roughly the size of two regular football
          fields. Due to the sheer amount of space, each team fields 18 players
          at a time, with four additional players available on the interchange
          bench. These extra players can be used tactically to influence certain
          periods of play, to replace injured players, or to keep the team fresh
          and rested throughout the match.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>The match</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each AFL game consists of four 20-minute periods and the umpire starts
          each quarter by bouncing the ball in the centre circle. Once the ball
          is bounced, it is considered ‘in play’ and the players can contest
          possession.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Scoring</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A player can score either a goal or a behind, with six points and one
          point awarded respectively. To score a goal, a player must kick the
          ball between the two middle posts, without it being ‘touched’ by
          another player. A behind is scored if the ball is kicked between the
          inside and outside posts, hits the two taller posts, or is carried
          behind or handballed across the goal line by a player, between any of
          the posts. The score is then presented to reflect the number of goals
          (six pointers) and the number of behinds (one pointers), with the
          combined score in brackets. For example: Essendon 15.12 (102) defeated
          Richmond 10.7 (67).
